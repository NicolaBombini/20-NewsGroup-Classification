# 20 NewsGroup Classification

The [dataset](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/), which is very popular in NLP tasks, contains about 20.000 documents divided into 20 categories. Our task was to classify the documents based on their content with three approaches: Machine Learning, Neural networks, Transformers.

The notebook in this folder contains code, a high detailed explanation and the results we've obtained.

For this project I worked in group with 3 colleagues of my university course.
